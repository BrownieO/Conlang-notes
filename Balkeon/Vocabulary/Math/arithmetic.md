# Arithmetic
Arithmetic deals with the manipulations of numbers.

Their operations are:
- addition = supr
- subtraction = maen
- multiplication = bhak/mult
- division = nhan/div
- exponentiation = elfnhan / elfmult
    - exponent suffix = fos

To assign maximum precedence to an operator, append "el" to it.
