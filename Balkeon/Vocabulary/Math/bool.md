# First order logic
First order logic deals with propositions that are either true or false.
You can create composite propositions using the following connectives:
- both = ara
- one or both = oro
- is equivalent = ekualber?

You can also negate a proposition by prepending "nek".
The negated connectives are:

- not both = nekara?
- not one nor both = nekoro?
- is not equivalent/only one = nekekualber?
