# Numbers
Numbers are mathematical objects used to count, measure and label.
There are two symbols used to denote them: the Arabic numerals, and words such as the cardinal, ordinal and fractional numerals.
The digits that form them are:

- 0 = Naul
- 1 = Uan
- 2 = Chos
- 3 = Tre
- 4 = Kuar
- 5 = Sink
- 6 = Sis
- 7 = Seti
- 8 = Oich
- 9 = Nuef

And the powers of ten are:
  
- 10 = Tek
- 100 = Dien
- 1000 = Miri
- 1000000 = Miliar

To form numerals with digit words, you have to be VERY CAREFUL and follow those rules:
- Start with the units. Continue to the right.
- Each digit needs a power of ten suffix.
- Each digit is separated by a space.

Example: 2024 = kuar chostek chosmiri

## Suffixes
Suffixes go in the rightmost digit.
- Cardinal numbers have no suffix.
- The ordinal suffixes are "yem", "esim", "ideon" or "idu".
- The fractional suffix is "ake". First, write the nominator and denominator separately. Then, append the suffix to the denominator.
