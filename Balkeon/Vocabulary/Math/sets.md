# Set theory
Sets, "upseon", are collections of elements. Their members are named "ambreon".

Sets have the following relationships:
- subset = inhabestir
- superset = inhabir
- complement = nekambrupeon

And the following operations:
- union = oro
- intersection = ara
- difference = maen
- cartesian product = nhan
- power set = elfnhanupeon
