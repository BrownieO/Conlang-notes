# Quantifiers
Quantifiers are roots that indicate amount. They are:
- tut = wholly
- part = at least some
- half = exactly 50%

Their meaning depends on the next root:
- "em": quantity
- other roots: quality
- gender: the concept

Example:
- tut + manon = wholly man
- tut + manidu = wholly masculine
- tut + em + manson = every man
- manon os tuteon = the whole of a man

You can prepend "tan" to get negated quantifiers:
- tantut: not at all
- tanpart: at least some isn't
- tanhalf: 50% isn't

Finally, nek + half means not exactly half.
