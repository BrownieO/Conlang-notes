# Radiation
Radiation is the remote transmission of energy.

## Electromagnetic radiation (Yahreon)
This consists of waves that combine both an electric and a magnetic field.
Those are named by their wavelength. E.g.:
- infrared = dakroneon
- visible = biradideon
- ultraviolet = onkraimoraskeon

## Particle radiation (Ipaneon)
This consists of fast subatomic particles. Materials with unstable nuclei are labelled "radioactive" (ipangideon), and they commonly emit alpha, beta and gamma particles.
