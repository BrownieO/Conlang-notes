# Conjunctions
Conjunctions are parts of speech that connect the words or groups of words around them.

The most used conjunctions are "<span translate="no" lang="es">ara</span>" (and) and "<span translate="no" lang="es">oro</span>" (or).

More conjunctions are available on [MetroManâ€™s website](https://metromansr.github.io/MetroWeb/en/balkeon/docs/conjunctions/) and in the [boolean connective page](https://brownieo.github.io/Balkeon-notes/Vocabulary/Math/bool.html).
