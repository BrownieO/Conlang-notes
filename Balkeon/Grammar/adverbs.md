# Adverbs
Adverbs answer a question about a word or sentence.
To make an adverb, append "<span translate="no" lang="es">in</span>". To make an independent adverb, append "<span translate="no" lang="es">un</span>". E.g.
- <span translate="no" lang="es">fastin</span> = quickly
- <span translate="no" lang="es">sadun</span> = sadly
