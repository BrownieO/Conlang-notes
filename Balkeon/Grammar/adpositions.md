# Adpositions
Adpositions show a physical or non-physical relationship between two words.

They can be placed as prepositions, postpositions or suffixes.
Prepositions must end with an L.

The most common adpositions are:
- of = <span translate="no" lang="es">os</span>
- inside = <span translate="no" lang="es">in</span>
- in = <span translate="no" lang="es">un</span>
- from = <span translate="no" lang="es">frok</span>
- towards = <span translate="no" lang="es">ta</span>
- with = <span translate="no" lang="es">ke</span>
- without = <span translate="no" lang="es">ne</span>

  The L suffix also marks definite words.
  Futher, the adpositions "in" and "un" are also the suffixes for adverbs.
