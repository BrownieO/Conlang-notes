# Phonology

## Alphabet
Balkeon uses part of the spanish alphabet. The excluded letters are J, Q, Ã‘, W and V.
The options for affricates (prompted by a mistake I made) are:
- C for Ch
- X for Sh
- Z for Ts

## Phonotactics
The following rules apply when forming words:
- For roots that end in a vowel: add an R behind the last suffix.
- For roots that end in a vowel, plus an U: add a B behind the last suffix.
- Avoid S or L + consonant; collapse the consonants or prepend an E.
- No thripthongs; insert R's between roots.
- No similar consonant clusters; Collapse them.

## Stress
All words are paroxytone, except when you need to make words distinct. Suffixes are considered syllables for stress.[1]

## Pitch
Bjornsdottirs proposes rising pitch on the stressed syllable and falling pitch at the next one.[1] WIP
