## Sample text - Nostra Fader
<p>
Nosta Fader, kien arte en palaizo,<br>
Sanktul sel vu namne.<br>
Vu regno naledoval.<br>
Vu sera sel huotov,<br>
Ic en palaizo, alozis tambon en hém.<br>
Obtem nos iste velcas nosta alleda pani.<br>

Et leidin nos non dentu verleidi,<br>
Pel levele os dasde malbon.<br>
