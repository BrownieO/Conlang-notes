## Introduction
The [Léxavelo](https://youtube.com/@Lexavelo-language-commitee) project is a closed community which also includes an English-based cant. The long-term goal is to open the community and develop its identity around a fully fledged auxlang.

## People
The project is run by Classicuscool. He is an Asian student and gamer who also speaks English and Spanish adequately.

## Alphabet
Lexávelo uses the full Spanish alphabet, plus the rare letters Á and É.

## Grammar
The project uses the English grammar, with the following known differences:
- No grammatical gender
- No suffixes
- No closed compound words
- Head-initial word order

## Vocabulary
There's no dictionary. Instead, the creator relies on memory and has posted around 2000 unique words.

The vocabulary is drawn to taste from "Romance languages, Greek, Dutch, Swedish, and few Czech, and a bit Arabic, and etc". This scope now includes all of Eurasia and even other conlangs.
