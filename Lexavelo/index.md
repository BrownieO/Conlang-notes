## Introduction
The [Léxavelo](https://youtube.com/@Lexavelo-language-commitee) project is a closed community where the creator speaks in an English-based cant. His long-term goal is to open this community and develop the identity around a fully fledged auxlang.

### People
The project is being run by Classicuscool. He is an Asian student and gamer who also speaks English and Spanish adequately.

## Alphabet
Lexávelo uses the full Spanish alphabet, plus the rare letters Á and É. The accented Á of Lexávelo is to make the name unique.

## Grammar
The grammar of English is being used, with the following known differences:

- Head-initial word order
- No grammatical gender
- Isolating bias
  - No closed compound words
  - No affixes

### Example: Tense
- Future: prepend the word "sera"
- Present: prepend the word "aola"
- Future: inflect the verb arbitrarily

## Vocabulary
There's no dictionary. Instead, the creator relies on his memory. Still, he has posted around 2000 unique words.

The vocabulary is drawn to taste from "Romance languages, Greek, Dutch, Swedish, and few Czech, and a bit Arabic, and etc". It also includes all of Eurasia and even other conlangs.
