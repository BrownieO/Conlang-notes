# Arithmetic
Arithmetic deals with the manipulations of numbers.

Their operations are:
- addition = supr.
- subtraction = maen.
- multiplication = bhak/mult.
- division = nhan/div.
- exponentiation = elfnhan / elfmult.
    - exponent suffix = fos.

To assign maximum precedence to an operator, append "el" to it.
