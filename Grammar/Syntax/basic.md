# Structure basics
Balkeon uses SVO for affirmations and VSO for questions.
The full structure is as follows:
1. Subject
2. Adverb
3. Second verb, main verb
4. Indirect object + "stan", direct object
5. Sentence modifier

The list of modifiers is on [MetroMan's website](https://www.metroman.me/balkeon/docs/adpositions/).
