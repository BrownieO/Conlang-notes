# Roots
Roots represent ontological entities. You can combine and suffix them to create words.

## Root stacking
Roots are stacked like in germanic languages. E.g.
- underground train = ah + chuch + <span translate="no" lang="es">train</span> + <span translate="no" lang="es">eon</span><span class="blind-only">.</span>
- Balkeon learning = <span translate="no" lang="es">Balkeon</span> + <span translate="no" lang="es">lern</span> + ian<span class="blind-only">.</span>

## Suffixation
Roots can be static or dynamic, like "dog" or "love". However, by adding a suffix, you can convert every root into a noun, verb or both.
